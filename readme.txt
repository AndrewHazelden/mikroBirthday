mikroBirthday
--------------

Celebrate a birthday by blowing out a virtual candle.

This example was created in celebration of MikroElektronika's 10th Birthday! 

You get to blow out the candle on a cupcake by tapping the touch screen on a 
mikromedia dsPIC 33 board. After two seconds the candle lights itself up again 
and you can repeat the process.

The example was created using MikroC Pro for dsPIC 5.20.
